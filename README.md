## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Reviewing the data image below; you will notice that the P-Values for Ground Clearance and MPG categories were sufficient below the standard P-Value of '.05'.  Given that they scored below the P-Value we can safely say that they would meet the criteria to provide non-random variance to performance.  While the remaining categories all scored above the average P-value indicating that they would fail to reject the null hypothesis - therefore providing random variance levels to performance.
